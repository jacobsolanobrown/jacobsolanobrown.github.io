      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <p>
        Our story takes us way back to ‘71, when our friends “Maggie May” and
        “Uncle Albert” were sitting pretty atop the Billboard charts. Those were
        the good ‘ole days... back in Detroit where it all began for us, and
        where streets were lined with the muscle car-laden beauty it had birthed
        itself. Tony was “dragging the line” then, working long hours,
        delivering pizzas in a bright orange Plymouth Duster with a handy FM
        converter in the glove box! Even though we may not have known it at the
        time, that’s when our story began: our love story with pizza!
        <br />
        <br />
        Tony and Karen embarked on this journey with their family by their side,
        as they trekked across the country- from Michigan to the gorgeous
        Pacific Northwest. This was technically a trip home for Karen, as she
        was born a Yakimaniac right at our very own Memorial Hospital! And it
        was here, in Yakima in 1992, when our family planted its roots in the
        valley, and opened the doors of our pizzeria!
        <br />
        <br />
        Our family has grown significantly since then, not only with our own
        children and their families, but with our hardworking and caring crew,
        who is also family to us! We have called Yakima our home for over 25
        years, and it is our mission to be your “go-to” hometown pizzeria! We ❤️
        you, Yakima!
