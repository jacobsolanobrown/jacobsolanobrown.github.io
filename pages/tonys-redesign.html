                        <p>
                            Tony's Big Cheese Pizza is a popular pizzeria in my hometown (Yakima, Washington) that gets significant traffic. Despite their good, cheap pizza, their current website lacks usability and accessibility, often leading customers (myself included) to prefer ordering by phone. This case study details how I identified key usability and accessibility issues and redesigned the site for a smoother, more intuitive, and responsive experience.

                            The usability issues on the Tonys Big Cheese Pizza website frequently drive customers to order by phone instead of using the website. The site lacks a clear hierarchy, making it difficult to navigate. It also has poor color contrast, making it hard to read.

                            I evaluated the website using criteria from interaction design principles: efficiency, learnability, and memorability.

                        <h4>Accessibility Analysis (WebAIM WAVE)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Images lacked helpful alt text, and the black-on-red color combination failed contrast checks, making the text difficult for visually impaired users. WebAIM's WAVE accurately identified these critical accessibility issues, confirming the need for improved color contrast and clear alt text.

                            Each mockup was thoroughly annotated to make the development of the website straightforward (Thank you auto layout in Figma)! Here are some examples of the annotations.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Layout Techniques: Clearly noted the use of Flexbox, and the direct amount of alignment, padding, and margins with auto layouts in Figma.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Responsiveness: Explained clearly how layout and font sizes adjust at each breakpoint.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Interactions: Defined default and hover states for buttons. Also configured a hamburger icon for when the nav bar was too large. (Although in the final deployed redesign, it is soley for visual purposes and not functional)

                        <p>Using my Figma mockups and design principles, I coded the final <a href="TonysBigCheesePizzaHomepage.html">Tonys Big Cheese Pizza Homepage</a> design with HTML and CSS. </p>

                            My redesign specifically addresses usability and accessibility issues by simplifying navigation, creating clear calls-to-action, enhancing visual hierarchy to make key information instantly accessible, improving accessibility through descriptive alt-text and better color contrast, and ensuring a responsive, enjoyable ordering experience across all devices. The result is a website that is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and accessible to all customers. Additionally, as an engineer, I ensured that the website is reliable and easy to maintain. I used semantic HTML and CSS best practices to ensure that the website is easy to read and understand. I also used a modular approach to design, which makes it easy to update and maintain the website in the future.

                            This project taught me the power of empathetic design; As an engineer designing for reliability, by thoughtfully addressing usability and accessibility, I transformed Tony's Pizza's online presence into an inviting, inclusive, and delightful experience! Something that is as enjoyable as their pizza itself! (seriously)
