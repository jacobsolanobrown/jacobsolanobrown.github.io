                Evaluating Common User Interface Components for Accessibility
              </h4>
              <p>
                Components are the building blocks to an interface, as they
                ensure consistency and usability within apps. However, as much
                as the design of these common components like buttons,
                checkboxes, and dropdowns are crucial to an application, so is
                the accessibility of the component. This is because accessible
                components allow a diverse user pool to interact with them in
                many different ways (inputs) and receive feedback from a variety
                of channels (outputs).
              </p>
              <p>
                This case study examines how an
                <strong>accordion</strong> component functions across three
                different applications:
              </p>
              <div class="design-grid">
                <div class="design-card">
                  <p>1. Ticketmaster Account Details (Website)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="design-card">
                  <p>2. The Sims 4 Simology Panel (Game)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="design-card">
                  <p>3. Brown University QuestBridge FAQ (Website)</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Each of these applications implement the component differently,
                influencing how users interact with it via mouse and keyboard
                inputs. The goal is to understand:
              </p>
              <div class="design-grid">
                <div class="design-card" style="background-color: #e1ddff99">
                  <p>1. How each application handles user input?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="design-card" style="background-color: #e1ddff99">
                  <p>
                    2. What visual and behavioral feedback is provided in
                    response to interactions?
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="design-card" style="background-color: #e1ddff99">
                  <p>3. How accessible the component is for different users?</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Beyond analysis, this project also explores potential
                improvements to the component by designing a revised version
                that enhances usability/accessibility for certain users. Through
                state models and annotated designs, we'll propose intentional
                trade-offs that balance functionality and accessibility.

              <h4>How do we use an Accordion?</h4>
              <p>
                Accordions are interactive UI components that organize content
                into expandable and collapsible sections, usually with mutliple
                sections, improving readability and navigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their effectiveness can depend on these key factors:
                <strong>learnability, efficiency, and memorability</strong>.
              </p>
              <div class="design-grid">
                <div class="design-card">
                  <p>
                    A well-designed accordion with great
                    <strong>learnability</strong> should be easy to understand
                    through clear visual cues, intuitive placement, and familiar
                    interaction patterns.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="design-card">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Efficiency</strong> is enhanced when users can
                    quickly expand or collapse sections with minimal effort,
                    such as through keyboard shortcuts or click-based
                    interactions.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="design-card">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Memorability</strong> is influenced by consistent
                    design allowing users to easily recall how to interact with
                    the accordion after their first use, reducing cognitive
                    load.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                However, different input and output methods such as mouse
                clicks, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility
                impact accessibility and the overall user experience.
              </p>
              <h4>Input/Output Examples</h4>
              <p>
                To explore how different input and output methods affect the
                user experience, I examined three applications that incorporate
                accordions:
                <strong>
                  Ticketmaster's Account Details, The Sims 4 Simology Panel, and
                  Brown University's QuestBridge FAQ Page.
                </strong>
                The following input/output table details the various ways users
                can interact with accordions across these applications.

                        header effect. The carrot points up (instead of down),

              <h4>Effects to the User Experience</h4>
              <p>
                After analyzing the input and output designs of our three
                applications, we can now better understand how different
                interactions impact the overall user experience. By examining
                how users engage with these applicaitons, we learn how certain
                design choices either support or hinder the user's ability to
                learn how to navigate the interface (learnability), perform
                tasks efficiently (efficiency), and retain that knowledge over
                time (memorability).

                    <p>
                      <strong>Learnability</strong>: Again, the accordion layout
                      is easy to learn, utilizing common conventions like
                      clicking to open and close sections. In Ticketmaster's
                      case, each content under a section is a button to load a
                      new subpage right to the accordion, making it easy to
                      learn how to navigate multiple pages. However, keep in
                      mind that some buttons load into entirely new pages,
                      without the accordion.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Memorability</strong>: The accordion structure
                      repeated throughout helps users easily memorize where to
                      search for account details like 'upcoming events' or
                      'billing information'. Additionally, the sections remain
                      open until they are manually closed, allowing for users to
                      remember section contents more easily once opened.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Efficiency</strong>: The accordion avoids
                      overwhelming the interface with too many sections and
                      section content, remedying unnecessary scrolling.

                      memorability, since some buttons load an entirely new
                      page, which can distrupt the user's navigation flow, it
                      may be difficult for users to remember which buttons load
                      new pages and which don't as to avoid distrupting their
                      flow.

                      <strong>Learnability</strong>: The accordion is easy to
                      use, utilizing common conventions like clicking to open
                      and close sections so that it is easy for new users to
                      navigate. The content in the sections are also easy to
                      digest as they are formatted well and usually have a hover
                      state to explain relevant information.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> Memorability</strong>: After learning the layout
                      of the Simology Panel, players can easily remember how to
                      utilize it because the accordion format does not change.
                      Additionally, the panel has a keyboard shortcut
                      (increasing efficiency) adding another way to remember the
                      panel for users. Nevertheless, the large number of
                      sections may complicate remembering specific parts of
                      navigation after a while.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Efficiency</strong>: The accordion format allows
                      fast navigation by allowing players to open and close
                      sections when necessary. Yet, since the panel is short and
                      there are many sections, if all the sections are open, it
                      will cause lag for the user since they will need to scroll
                      to find a certain section. The Sims addresses this by
                      being able to resize the panel by the small handlebar on
                      top of the panel.

                      that enables users to find the question quickly. However,
                      the FAQ structure may be overwhelming at first (given more
                      questions), so grouping similar questions can simplify
                      learning.

                      questions remain open once they are expanded as well.
                      Since FAQs are accessed infrequently, users won't
                      necessarily remember where specific answers are. But the
                      minimalist design is easy enough to come back to find the

                      unnecessary scrolling. However, constant searching within
                      sections can be time-consuming, and a search option would
                      be a beneficial (especially given more questions).

              <h4>Accordion State Models</h4>
              <p>
                Accordions are an already well-optimized UI component, balancing
                space usage and usability. However, looking again at how users
                interact with it (through mouse, keyboard, or assistive
                technology), we can find small but critical improvements that
                make it more usable, efficient, or accessible. The question
                isn't so much whether it works, but whether it might work
                better.
              </p>
              <h4>State Models for Redesigning</h4>
              <p>
                We can use various state models to better understand user
                interactions, creating opportunities for refinement. By
                analyzing both mouse and keyboard interactions, we can identify
                points of friction and potential improvements in accessibility
                and efficiency. In this section, we will focus on redesigning
                Ticketmaster's accordion component to enhance usability while
                considering intentional trade-offs, given Ticketmaster's initial
                state models.

                  />
                  <figcaption>
                    This emphasizes that other headers in the accordion stay
                    open regardless of changing another headers section.

                Building from these insights, we can now discuss a redesign that
                purposefully makes compromises to achieve a better user
                experience without compromising core functionality.

              <h4>Redesigning Ticketmaster's Accordion</h4>
              <div class="image-frame">
                <img
                  src="../images/accessible-components-assets/Initial_State_(Redesign).jpg"
                  alt="Redesigned Accordion component from Ticketmaster with all sections closed"
                />
              </div>
              <h5>Ticketmaster's Accordion Redesign - Default State</h5>
              <p>
                First, I chose to add a new state to Ticketmaster's Accordion by
                having all the sections be closed by default and only having the
                accordion being visible.

                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Trade-off:</strong> starting with every panel closed
                adds one extra click to see content, yet delivers a clean first
                view. This uncluttered layout instantly signals “click to open”
                <strong>(learnability)</strong>, is easy to recall on return
                visits <strong>(memorability)</strong>, and cuts initial
                scrolling and visual noise <strong>(efficiency)</strong>.
              </p>
              <div class="image-frame">
                <img
                  src="../images/accessible-components-assets/Open_State_Redesign.jpg"
                  alt="Redesigned Accordion component from Ticketmaster including highlighted open section"
                />
              </div>
              <h5>Ticketmaster's Accordion Redesign - Open Section State</h5>
              <p>
                Then, I chose to emphasize the current selected and open section
                by highlighing the current section header with blue, giving the
                close chevron button a label, and having all other sections
                closed in the accordion.
                <br />
                <br />

                <strong>Trade-off:</strong> By hiding other panels, it removes
                side‑by‑side comparison, but the blue highlight and “Close”
                label give a single, focal point. Users grasp the pattern at a
                glance <strong>(learnability)</strong>, recall the “blue = open”
                rule next visit <strong>(memorability)</strong>, and scroll less
                to reach content <strong>(efficiency)</strong> as only one
                section is open at a time.

                As a full-stack SWE who aims to build with precision, this case
                study clarifies how intentional accessibility improvements
                transform a simple accordion into an intuitive, inclusive
                experience.
              </p>
              <h4>Usability &amp; Accessibility Strengths</h4>
              <p>
                Across Ticketmaster, Sims 4 and Brown FAQ accordions we saw
                clear capabilities (chevrons, plus/minus toggles), keyboard
                operability (Tab → Enter) and screen-reader announcements. In
                our redesign we preserved these cues and added:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Visible section highlighs</li>
                <li>“Close” labels for clarity</li>
                <li>Less selectable content by default</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Additional Accessibility Considerations</h4>
              <p>We addressed gaps in accessibility design by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ensuring contrast ratios are met for all text and icons
                  (included the new blue highlight)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adding a “Close” label to the chevron icon for screen readers
                  and simpler interprebility
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Solving a “Mismatch”</h4>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8"
                  >Kat Holmes</a
                >
                defines a mismatch in design as users who do not match into the
                assumption of the user profile a designer created for them. In
                my design, I tried to include other user profiles by adding more
                options. By closing all panels by default and emphasizing one
                section at a time, we removed visual clutter and supported users
                with cognitive or visual impairments who need a clear focal
                point and have the option to focus on one section at a time.
              </p>

              <h4>Impact on Users with Impairments</h4>
              <p>
                Given users with impairments, there are still more positive and
                negative ways our inputs and outputs can effect them, such as
                when an opening animation occurs, it can affect them by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Positive:</strong> Screen-reader users hear “expanded”
                  announcements, improving orientation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Negative:</strong> Rapid animations can disorient
                  users with vestibular sensitivities if not reduced or
                  disabled.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>User Prioritization</h4>
              <p>
                Mouse and keyboard interactions tend to be prioritized in
                component design. This can isolate touch-only and
                assistive-technology users by overlooking tap targets and ARIA
                focus management, leading to inconsistent experiences for these
                users.
              </p>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>
                This case study demonstrates how a focused, iterative redesign,
                focused on accessibility research, and user testing, can evolve
                an already well designed accordion into an even more universally
                intuitive, dependable interface. By balancing technical
                precision with purposeful trade-offs and a dash of curiosity, it
                reflects a great approach for any designer and engineer to
                create with purpose and others in mind.
